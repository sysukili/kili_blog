    abstract = {Competing risks issues are common in clinical trials and epidemiological studies for patients in follow-up who may experience a variety of possible outcomes. Under such competing risks, two hazard-based statistical methods, cause-specific hazard (CSH) and subdistribution hazard (SDH), are frequently used to assess treatment effects among groups. However, the outcomes of the CSH-based and SDH-based methods have a close connection with the proportional hazards (CSH or SDH) assumption and may have an non-intuitive interpretation. Recently, restricted mean time lost (RMTL) has been used as an alternative summary measure for analysing competing risks, due to its clinical interpretability and robustness to the proportional hazards assumption. Considering the above approaches, we summarize the differences between hazard-based and RMTL-based methods from the aspects of practical interpretation, proportional hazards model assumption and the selection of restricted time points, and propose corresponding suggestions for the analysis of between-group differences under competing risks. Moreover, an R package ‘cRMTL’ and corresponding step-by-step guidance are available to help users for applying these approaches.},

    abstract = {According to long-term follow-up data of malignant tumor patients, assessing treatment effects requires careful consideration of competing risks. The commonly used cause-specific hazard ratio (CHR) and sub-distribution hazard ratio (SHR) are relative indicators and may present challenges in terms of proportional hazards assumption and clinical interpretation. Recently, the restricted mean time lost (RMTL) has been recommended as a supplementary measure for better clinical interpretation. Moreover, for observational study data in epidemiological and clinical settings, due to the influence of confounding factors, covariate adjustment is crucial for determining the causal effect of treatment.},
